								Hi
								</p>
								Driven by a longstanding fascination with with the brain and its functioning, I've recently graduated from the University of Amsterdam with a Master of Psychology (research) and 
								I'm currently searching for a PhD position in cognitive neuroscience to discover more.
								
								Alongside my academic ambitions, I’m open to analytically driven roles outside academia where rigorous research and data-driven thinking are central.
								</p>
								<p>
								Beyond that I'm a literature (see <a href="books.html">books of the year</a>) and film enthusiast (<a href="https://boxd.it/8KhGN" target="_blank" rel="noopener">letterboxd <3</a>), yogi, and music consumer. I was born and raised just outside of Helsinki in Finland
								but moved to Amsterdam six years ago to study psychology. I loved my time in The Netherlands but now it's time for something new.
								</p>
								Sustainability is one of my core values.
								That's why (and because it's fun) I've learnt to sew clothes, crochet and knit.
								It's also why you might find me on a 48 hour journey from Helsinki to Amsterdam.
								At the same time, I’ll admit I have a bit of cognitive dissonance about travel: I love exploring the world, and since I can’t sail everywhere, I do sometimes fly. 
								So far, I’ve travelled in Australia, South America, and Asia—most recently India and Japan, which I absolutely loved. 
					
								<p>
								This year I'm seeking slow hours. breaking patterns to find clarity. finding pockets of time. getting bored. creativity arises from boredom. 
								</p>
								<p>
								Nice to meet you. I'm happy you have found to this space.

								<strong>The Case of Curiosity: </strong> <br>
								Theta Oscillations and Intrinsic Motivation Modelling in Spatial Exploration
								</p>
								<p>
								For my master thesis I investigated brain oscillations during free exploration and tried to predict brain activity using a self-supervised model called Random Network Distillation.
								If you're curious, here is a short description of what we did. If you are even more curious (love it) and would like to read the thesis, please
								<a href="#contact">reach out</a>.
								</p>

								<p>
								Curiosity and spatial learning are closely related, especially when we explore new places and need to build (and update) a mental map of our surroundings.
								Brain activity in the theta frequency range (4–8 Hz) is often linked to navigation and memory, but it’s still not totally clear how theta relates to curiosity-driven exploration.

								In this project, I recorded scalp EEG from 36 participants while they completed a virtual navigation task in both novel and familiar environments.
								To connect brain signals with curiosity, I used a self-supervised intrinsic motivation model—Random Network Distillation (RND; Burda et al., 2018)—to generate time-aligned curiosity estimates,
								and compared these with changes in theta power during navigation. I also looked at how environmental context affected theta-band effective connectivity and exploratory behaviour.

								Overall, theta power and front-to-back (anterior-to-posterior) connectivity were consistently present during navigation, but they didn’t significantly differ between novel and familiar environments (p &gt; 0.05).
								Behaviourally, exploration patterns did change: roaming behaviour (measured using Roaming Entropy) varied across conditions, with the strongest relationship showing up during novel exploration
								(&rho; = 0.34, p = 0.047).

								A key contribution of this work was combining model-based curiosity scores with EEG dynamics. Both curiosity scores and theta activity increased in response to novel stimuli.
								Using ridge regression, curiosity scores predicted theta power slightly but reliably above chance (R&sup2; = 0.07), especially early in the task during familiarisation, which was confirmed with permutation testing.
								Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) also showed small but consistent alignment between the curiosity and theta time series.

								Overall, these results suggest theta activity is a stable feature of navigation, and exploratory behaviour may relate most strongly to theta during novel environments.
								This project also introduces a method for linking computational curiosity models with neural signals during real-time exploration, offering a step toward better understanding how curiosity and spatial learning work together in the brain.

								Individual Brain Parcellation in Autism Spectrum Condition</h2> -->

								<p>
								<strong>Functional Connectivity Landscape and
								Individual Brain Parcellation in Autism Spectrum Condition </strong> <br>
								
								</p>
								<p>
								For my research internship, I worked on a project exploring how brain connectivity differs between autistic and non-autistic individuals using functional MRI. I was especially interested
								 in individual differences in brain organisation: how much a person’s brain network organisation might be “unique” rather than fitting neatly into a standard template. If you're curious to read my whole report, 
								 I'd be happy to <a href="#contact">send it over</a>.
								</p>
								<p>
								A big part of the project was testing the idea that autism might be linked to more heteregenous brain organisation. Inspired by graph theory analysis of networks, I focused on the balance 
								between modularity (specialised networks) and efficiency (how the networks connect). We analysed functional connectome data from 11 participants (5 autistic and 6 non-autistic), each scanned
								 across three sessions.
								 </p>
								<p>
								I combined our dataset with a large existing sample of non-autistic individuals (N ≈ 800), which enabled comparisons to a wider reference population using individualised brain parcellation and graph-theory metrics.
								</p>
								<p>
								One of the most interesting findings was how much individualised brain parcellation changed the “connectome landscape” compared to standard atlases. When we used community assignment, modularity increased noticeably, 
								and this effect wasn’t specific to autistic participants. Overall, the project reinforced how important personalised approaches can be when studying complex brain networks, and it deepened my interest in the link 
								between brain organisation and cognition.
